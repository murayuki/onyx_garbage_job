# onyx_garbage_job
A Garbage Job for fivem
# Installation
Put the onyx_garbagejob in resources and add onyx_garbagejob (You are of course allowed to change the name)
# Tutorial on how to add locations
When you have added the resource and are ingame you should be able to do /loc and a message will pop up in the console <br>
You need to copy it and put it in the client/main.lua under the trashboi table (DO NOT NAME IT ANYTHING AS IF YOU HAVE TO MANY BLIPS WITH NAMES IT WILL BREAK)<br>

# Tutorial on to add a way to get money 
Go into server/main.lua and find http://prntscr.com/nyxsmv and then add your shit there, if you put for example givemoneyblabla(trash * 5)
it will give as much money as trash you have but times 5 <br>
so if you have 100 trash in your truck it will give $500 <br>
